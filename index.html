      <p>
        We present Sparse Fusion Transformers (SFT), a novel multimodal fusion
        method for transformers that performs comparably to existing
        state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating up to a six-fold reduction
        in computation and memory requirements.

      <h2>
        Interpolating Latent Representations to Increase Label Noise Tolerance
      </h2>

      </p>
      <p>
        We propose the use of a modality-agnostic label noise tolerant technique
        involving training on interpolated latent representations along with
        their labels, encouraging neural networks to predict less confidently on
        these in-between examples. Our technique reduces the memorization of
        corrupt labels, which can alleviate the issue of noisy labels.

        CLEFNET: Recurrent Autoencoders with Dynamic Time Warping for

      <p>
        We propose an architecture (Latent Space) for a platform with
        end-to-end, near-lossless audio transmission tailored specifically to
        online joint music production. We discuss the usage of a recurrent
        autoencoder (ClefNet), propose a new evaluation metric (MSE-DTW), and
        detail the logistics of a live system implementation.
